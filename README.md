# Project_SP22

This repository includes codes and discussions for STAT431 and PSYC489 final projects in the Spring 22 at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
<br>Here we applied a machine learning-based classifier, either a multi-perceptron (perceptron.py) or a hierarchical Bayesian model (bayesian.R), to a publicly available [EEG dataset](https://osf.io/4hq3y/) of individuals with subclinical depression. 

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to build widely used machine learning models from scratch.
<br>For more details, please refer to perceptron_report.pdf and bayesian_report.pdf. 

## Environment
Python 3.10 (64-bit)
<br>R 4.1.1

## Usage
This project contains

・EEG band power preprocessing (Eyes-closed EEG.xlsx)
<br>・multi-perceptron with the back propagation algorithm (perceptron.py) 
<br>・hierarchical Bayesian model using Rjags (bayesian.R)

For those who want to learn about those structures and algorithms, it is a good practice to start out.
